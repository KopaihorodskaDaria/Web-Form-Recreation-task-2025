# NYC TC108 Web Form Recreation

This project is a web-based recreation of the official NYC TC108 form (pages 3–4 of the PDF).
The form is implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (This is a client-side only solution)  and allows users to:
- Fill out all fields similar to the PDF form
- Save the entered data into a json file
- Import data from a JSON file back into the form
- Get basic validation for required fields and helpful inline hints
- Use the form across different screen sizes with responsive design

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, responsive design)  
- JavaScript (client-side logic, validation, file handling)  

## Usage
1. Fill out the form directly in the browser.
2. Click Save to download a JSON file with your data.
3. Click Import to upload a JSON file and repopulate the form.
4. If required fields are missing, a validation message will appear.

## How Cursor AI Helped in This Project

This was my first time using Cursor AI, and it proved extremely helpful — very convenient for learning, guiding me step by step, and making the development process much easier and more effective.

- Review and optimization — checked whether my layout and styling decisions were optimal and helped remove unused elements.
- Styling and layout —  made the form more polished and responsive.
- Code comments — added explanations to make the structure of HTML, CSS, and JS clearer.
- JS logic implementation — explained step by step how to:
  - validate required fields,
  - create a JSON object from form data,
  - save this JSON as a file,
  - import the file and repopulate the form.
- Improving clarity — helped format and organize the code so that it looked clean, structured, and professional.
NOTE: The chat logs with Cursor AI are stored in the cursor-logs/ folder.
